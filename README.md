# The-Gaming-Room-Design-Document
Our client for this project was The Gaming Room. They wanted us to create an application for a game that would have the user guess the puzzle through a library of images. I feel I understood the requirements for this program very well, and through the planning stages and documentation I felt very confident. I felt the Domain model section of the design document helped me the most because it gave me an understanding of the classes, and functions that I needed to implement in the code. I would revise the design constraints because I feel like at the time of writing I did not fully understand what the constraints would be, and feel I could do better on that section now. I feel the users needs are the most important part of a project like this, because if the user does not get what they expected or wanted they will be disapointed. The end-user are the people who will be using the program and ultimatley have the final say in if it succeeds. I struggled with the designing portion of this project and feel I could have done much better. In the future I would try different ways of implementing the procceses I was trying to, and debug more as I went through instead of having to do much more work at the end.
